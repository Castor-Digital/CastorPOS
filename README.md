# CastorPOS: 

CastorPOS is a cash register and point-of-sale handling app built in Java for Android devices. It provides an intuitive interface for managing basic cash register functions, tracking waitstaff and the number of customers they serve, and maintaining a waitlist for taking names and reservations.
